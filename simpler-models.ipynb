       "       b\"Feature-length documentary centered around the terrifying and world-renowned House of Shock, taking audiences on a dark and fast-paced journey they'll never forget through one of the most extreme haunted houses the world has ever seen. Complete with all the blood, guts, heavy metal and mayhem that has kept House of Shock at the forefront for two decades, this movie peels back the skin to explore the huge and growing obsession with fear itself as the uniting force behind a subculture that can't get enough of things that go bump in the night and make your hair stand on end. The House of Shock, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, and first established by, among others, Pantera frontman - Phil Anselmo, has been a haven for some of heavy metal and hard rock's biggest stars over the years and was named by the Travel Channel as America's most extreme haunted attraction. Despite protests and attacks by religious groups and the impact of Hurricane Katrina, House of Shock continues to bring its own brand of terror to the masses year after year. Featuring live musical performances, freak shows, suspension acts and a skin-melting pyrotechnic stage show, House of Shock prepares its all-too-willing patrons for a horrifying gauntlet of monsters, demons and pure evil that leaves some crying, some laughing and some literally scared to death. HOS, filmed during House of Shock's 20th season, captures this bone-chilling experience from every angle and explores the subculture of the fear-obsessed through interviews with some of the biggest names in metal, hard rock and horror, as well as patrons, fans, dissenters and those who work behind the scenes to bring House of Shock and other horror content and attractions to life. No matter their walk of life, those who crave the rush of being afraid and those who dedicate themselves to creating ever more terrifying experiences for others are bound by their obsession with fear - and a family is born.\",\n",
